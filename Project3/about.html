      <h3 class="uppercase">Skilled team</h3>
      <p>In February 2020 the Washington Post reported that a large Nike supplier factory, Qingdao Taekwang Shoes Co., had been employing Uighurs from the Xinjiang region of China. The article referenced a report which said Uighurs in the Taekwang factory were working “under conditions that strongly suggest forced labor”. </p>

      <h3 class="uppercase">Creative Factories</h3>
      <p>The factories, which are often housed in deteriorating buildings, are cramped with workers and pose fire dangers. Workers are also restricted access to the toilet and drinking water during the day.</p>

      <p>Nike also uses leather as a substantial part of its business. The leather industry uses a cocktail of harmful chemicals to preserve leather. Tannery effluent also contains large amounts of other pollutants which can pollute the land, air and water supply, making it a highly polluting industry. </p>

      <h3 class="uppercase">FAIR PAY</h3>
      <p>In 2019 Nike’s highest paid Executive Officer received an astonishing $13,968,022 – around £11m. Five named Executive Officers received over £1m in total compensation in the same year, which Ethical Consumer considers to be excessive pay.</p>

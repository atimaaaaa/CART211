        <h3> Hi I'm Atima! I’m a graphic designer focused on delivering meticulous designs focused on but not limited to editorial, motion design and branding design. My goal is to add an edge to my work in order to inspire creatives, designers and
          clients alike. By exploring the intersection of design and interactivity, I am left with an environment I wish to explore and understand its limits.</h3>
        <h3>
          My computer screen serves as a frame for others to view my work and as my blank canvas to fill with colors and shapes. I strive for greatness and not perfection because limiting my attention to one project stops the creation process and
          exploring my visual identity. My goal is to leave the viewers to feel curious about the limitations of design in the form of graphic design, interactive design, and web design. The “wow” moment is key in my work: to make one forget of
          reality for a moment and truly be immersed in an environment with a focus on the interactivity between forms and be stimulated by the power of colors. My creations are meant to feel like an experience you would want to visualize at over and
          over again due to its complexities in the researched details elevating the core subject of the project. It is for those who are willing to stop and admire work carefully designed to form a meaningful relationship between the art and the
          viewer.

        <h2>As We May Think</h2>

        <p>Information is data gathered at a certain point in time. This data is researched by individuals at the time, gathering billions of thoughts. When the author mentions how users who do not research will not keep up with the current scene fascinating. To create for the future means knowing the past and what has been done. Innovative strategy and ideas are brought upon by individuals who can relate ideas to another.</p>

        <p>The idea of selection of one-hundredth of a second is an interesting concept. Will some industries benefit from receiving accurate information instantly? Certainly, certain medical and political fields would benefit from clear and concise information as at times it is a matter of life and death. I find it fascinating the author mentions how no one would spend extra money to apply this concept to the telephone system. What if there is a home emergency? What if Russia is seconds away from attacking the United States? While practical to receive information instantaneously, the idea of privacy is put to question. Will the human be fully living their lives without the control and invasion of technology? </p>

        <p>What I found interesting was reading the author’s prediction for technology, which did not exist at the time of the publication, but is available in current times. The development of the automatic telephone exchange leads to a desire to combine the microphone, a speech-controlled typewriter, to make selections, which is equivalent to the speech assistants and artificial intelligence virtual assistants occupying in many homes today. I find it revolutionary as a society, aiming to create products to fill a need in people’s lives.  These products were created with intention and purpose targeted directly to consumers who are not aware of these new desires. In a way, there are a lot of companies today creating products unnecessary to the development of the human, but the marketing and design team are able to create a sense of “missing out” when one misses out on new technology releases. The pioneers Apple are shaping the new generation creating an eco-system of products. The problem lies in how the idea of owning the entirety of the product will bring joy and happiness. The idea of owning an Apple product feels more luxe and special than it is in reality. Many industries in today’s world utilize marketing to promote a fake sense of desire.

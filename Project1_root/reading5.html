        <h2>GNU Manifesto</h2>

        <p>GNU was a proposal written by Richard Stallman in 1985 to ask for support for the GNU, an alternative Unix-compatible software system, from the public and programmers. The proposal states GNU adapting its software from the existing Unix software system is beneficial to users and programmers because it is widely accessible and easily adaptable from both standpoints.</p>
        <p>The issue at the time with software systems was the division between the propriety systems and open-source systems. Users were unhappy with the commercialization of software systems because it forced users to limit their program shares with other users, thus creating a bubble between every programmer. The use and implementation of the GNU was widely encouraged by the programming community because it encouraged the new concept of sharing. Stallmanâ€™s manifesto asked for anyone in the community to contribute rather financially or through labour work. The public who had a passion for programming was encouraged to join a new community focused on building an improvement on the current flawed software system at the time. </p>
        <p> Proprietary software programs are programs that demand a sum of money to access and use their product. Their goal is to gain the maximum profit while limiting sharing resources amongst users. As a programmer, having a choice between a multitude of cutting-edge propriety software programs is great, but this leads to the programmer to be stuck in a vicious circle of products and system they, unfortunately, cannot get away with. The open-source format is a model still in use today such as Github which allowed common folks like myself to have access to a multitude of resources at a simple click of a mouse. </p>

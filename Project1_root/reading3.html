        <h2>Web Work: History of Internet Art</h2>

        <p>There is no denying the influence of net.art allowed the individual to explore their creativity and express their beliefs in the deep world of the Internet. It started off as a niche hub for users to use a platform that was awaiting to
          shine and stay relevant. It was the gathering spot for users to blend in their everyday life and design. Without any corporate advertisements, any data trackers, and any fear of browsing the web, users were attracted to find communities
          related to their hobbies and contribute to grow bigger and stronger communities. All these people were instantly reachable and communication never felt easier. In a way, the Internet felt significant at the end of the 90’s economically and
          culturally as the web offered a space for users to conveniently share their art as well as their radical ideals on the world such as the VNS Matrix. Culturally, ideas were shared and more point of views emerged with the rise of the
          Internet. </p>
        <p>While the Internet artists were driven by hope of creating and sharing content relevant to cultural themes, these artists suffered economically as they were not paid for their work building off the foundation of Internet art. Shared
          ideologies were not constantly welcomed with opened arms. </p>
        <p> The presence of Internet trolls emerged in the form of negative comments, identity tricks and destabilized the communities. With the rise of publishing manifestos and resorting to polemics from Nettime’s ZKP Series to Heritage Gold, it is
          from the chosen software and computers enabling users to produce, propagate and share their voice. </p>
        <p>Net artists are responsible for building the foundation for popular social media apps in today’s modern age. It is instinctive for humans to search for communities with similar passions and interests. Behind every website lies years of
          experimentation from net artists and web designers. While not monetarily compensated for their work, these artists allowed users today to continue to design personal websites with much ease than ever before. </p>

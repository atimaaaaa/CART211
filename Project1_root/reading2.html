        <h2>The Time Canada Wanted Its Own Internet Because It Thought the US Would Mess It Up</h2>

        <p>The modern civilian today use the Internet to complete their everyday tasks such as finding a new recipe, browsing on Wikipedia or lurking at their favorite celebrities on social media. In Canada, it is no different. In this week’s
          article, the topic of personal information, privatization and technological sovereignty was discussed.</p>

        <p>Modern applications and softwares based on the United States are extremely common and easily accessible on any device, no matter the platform. Your average grandmother from France can easily chat up her grandaughter from Canada with a
          simple click on the Facebook app. The ease of accessibility and ease of convenience makes it easy to connect and reconnect with loved ones. There is no denying this practicality comes at a cost: the user’s data. Without any awareness of the
          consequences, the average user is prompt to input personal information for the reason that an app asked them so. The user is not aware of how simple data localization can mean to corporations whose goal is to make money off their
          information. How many times have we impulsively purchased an item because there was an advertisement on the page we were casually scrolling on? Sensitive and private information should be withheld from any discussions on the internet. It is
          almost impossible nowadays to browse our computers without the information saved somewhere. In a way, is it that inconvenient? Some features such as Google Drive and Notion are helpful apps for students to keep track of their homework and
          lectures. A simple password auto-fill will help your average grandmother access her Facebook without searching in her notebooks for it. There is to some extent convenience in certain data-tracking
          applications.</p>

        <p>With the United States growing monopoly over its infrastructure and monopoly of the internet, Canada has to consider its options. Is it worth it launching a Canadian version of what our neighbors have solidly created and is used by
          millions of users? With whose money will this project be funded? Will the provinces or private companies be held accountable for any issues? </p>

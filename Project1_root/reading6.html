        <h2>The Yes Man will Fix the World</h2>

        <p>There are many ways to be available to an audience. Online protests a new way of manifesting thoughts and feasible solutions. Catastrophe at a company similar to Chernobyl. Reparations were on the way but was then refused to commit to said reparations for the health and safety of the workers. Solutions were proposed during the video, but when it was revealed it was a hoax, the efforts were not taken seriously. The Yes Man creates websites similar to the real websites as representatives of the real websites. Using satire is very effective.</p>
        <p>Using the media to educate and inform society by activist does not always make an impact. Those in powers are often times just in it for themselves to protect their power and prestige. Voting is an important event to start a movement. Adbusters is part of an activist group that became known from Occupy Wall Street in New York City, inspired by the Arab Spring, would go to their financial district to protest against inequality.  Some would say it was a failed movement because the movement did not have a clear narrative to protest against. There were no leaders of the movement who would negotiate and ask for gals to achieve. In a way, a leaderless manifestation lets the people to express and involve themselves politically. The inequality in income was the main cause of the start of culture jamming. While it might not have a direct impact the day of the event, it is about the repercussion and ripple effect to inspire generations to come to manifest for the fight for the future.</p>
